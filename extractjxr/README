This directory contains the source code for `extractjxr`, a utility for
extracting image tiles out of a CZI image.

To build, you must have libuuid installed (`uuid-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu
derived system). Invoke `make` at the command line to build
`extractjxr` and then run it with the `-h` flag to see available
options.

Note that the files under the `compat/` directory have been imported from
OpenSMTPD, as some non-portable BSD extensions to the standard library are used.
These files are copyright (c) their respective authors.
